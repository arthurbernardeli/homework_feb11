# Assignment topic
- This file summarizes the materials and methods of a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) on soybean seed composition traits.

# **Summary of Materials and Methods**

---

# 1. Plant Materials and Experimental Design

## Plant Population
- 321 *Glycine max* (soybean) plant introductions (PIs) were selected from the USDA Soybean Germplasm Collection.
- The population was restricted to early maturity groups (MG 0 and MG 00) due to soybean’s photoperiod sensitivity.
- 91% of the PIs originated from China.

## Field Trials and Experimental Design
- Conducted in three locations:  
  - Aurora (2011)  
  - Brookings (2012)  
  - Watertown (2012), South Dakota  
- Experimental Design:
  - Randomized complete block design with three replications.
  - Field setup referenced from Zhang *et al*., 2015a, 2015b.

# 2. Phenotypic Evaluation and Statistical Analysis

## Traits Measured
  - Seed protein
  - Oil content
  - Five fatty acids
  - 18 amino acids

## Method of Analysis
- Near-Infrared Reflectance (NIR) Spectroscopy DA-7200 (Perten Instruments, Sweden).
- Calibrations from 2011 were applied, covering 915–3641 samples per seed component.
- Correlation coefficients: ranged from 0.77 for stearic acid to 0.97 for protein (average: 0.90).
- Trait heritability and variance analysis were based on prior studies (Zhang *et al*., 2015a, 2015b).

# 3. Genotyping, Quality Control, and Genome-wide Linkage Disequilibrium (LD)

## Reference Genome
- *Glycine max* reference genome: *Glyma.Wm82.a2* (*SoyBase*, [soybase.org](http://soybase.org/)).

## Genotyping Platform
- Illumina Infinium SoySNP50K BeadChip used for SNP genotyping.
- Contains 52,041 SNPs, filtered from an original 209,903 SNPs.

## Final SNP Dataset Used
- 31,850 SNPs retained (Minor Allele Frequency (MAF) ≥ 5%).
- 313 out of 321 PIs used (8 PIs lacked genotyping data).

## Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) Estimation
- Performed as per Zhang et al., 2015b.

# 4. Genome-wide Association Study (GWAS) Analysis

## Best Linear Unbiased Predictors (BLUPs)
- BLUPs were calculated for all traits.

## GWAS Methods Used
- Single-locus Mixed Linear Model (MLM) (Yu *et al*., 2006).
- Multi-Locus Mixed Model (MLMM) (Segura *et al*., 2012).
- Implemented using GAPIT package (Zhang *et al*., 2010; Lipka *et al*., 2012).

## Population Structure Analysis
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using all SNPs.
- STRUCTURE software (K=3) to classify subgroups.

## Differentiation & Statistical Analysis
- Fixation Index (Fst) calculated using R package snpStats.
- Bonferroni correction applied (P < 1.57 × 10⁻*).

---

# 5. QTL Mapping and Candidate Gene Prediction

## QTL Mapping Method
- Loci mapped using SSR markers from Consensus 4.0 sequence (*SoyBase*).

## Candidate Gene Annotation
- Gene models used:
  - Glyma1.0
  - Glyma1.1
  - NCBI RefSeq

## Allele Frequency Analysis
- Conducted on:
  - 96 wild soybeans (*G. soja*)
  - 92 landraces
  - 96 elite cultivars
- Data sourced from *SoyBase*

---

# 6. Geographic and Phylogenetic Analysis of Alleles

## Dataset Used
- 13,195 accessions, including wild and cultivated soybeans.

## Geographic Origin
- Wild Soybean (*G. soja*) Origins:
  - China (158)
  - South Korea (307)
  - Japan (293)
- Cultivated Soybean (*G. max*) Origins:
  - China (5096)
  - North Korea (224)
  - South Korea (3380)
  - Japan (2877)

## Phylogenetic Analysis
- Conducted using R package ape (Paradis *et al*., 2004).
- Focused on rare allele regions.

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.
```{r}

```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
